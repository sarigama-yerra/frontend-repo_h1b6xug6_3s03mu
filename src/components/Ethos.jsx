          <p className="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
            An elevated men’s athletic and streetwear label rooted in the quiet intensity of combat sports. Minimalist, disciplined, and built for the grind. We design for performance without the noise — refined silhouettes, premium technical fabrics, and a mindset that rewards consistency over clout.

            Start Something is the invitation and the challenge. It’s the first step, the decision to enter the struggle and let it shape you. Our pieces are made to disappear when you move — sharp, functional, and considered.
